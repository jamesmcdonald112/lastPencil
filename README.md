# Last Pencil Game
The Last Pencil Game is a simple game where two players take turns removing 1 to 3 pencils from a pile. 
The player forced to take the last pencil loses the game. This project includes a bot that follows a winning strategy to make the game more challenging and replayable.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Last\ Pencil\ \(Java\)/task/src/
```

- Compile the Java files using the following command:

```bash
javac lastpencil/*.java
```

- Run the game using the following command:

```bash
java lastpencil.Main
```

## How to Play
- The game starts by asking how many pencils you'd like to use.
- You will be asked to choose who will play first: John (user) or Jack (bot).
- Players take turns to remove 1, 2, or 3 pencils from the pile.
- The player who takes the last pencil loses the game.
- The bot (Jack) will always follow a winning strategy if possible.

## Conclusion
Again, I am really starting to understand the importance of planning. 
The better it is planned the easier it is to put together. 
I also really found that separating concerns and making this more modular made life much easier. That will be my focus in the next project.

Additional Notes
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine to run this project.
To start the game, run the Main.java file.
The bot's strategy is designed to follow a winning pattern whenever possible, making the game both challenging and fun.
