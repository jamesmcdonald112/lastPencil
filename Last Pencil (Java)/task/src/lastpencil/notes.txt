First validate input
- "The number of pencils should be numeric" this includes minus numbers, as minus is not a number.
So positive numbers only.
- The number of pencils must be greater than 0 - "The number of pencils should be positive"

Validate name
- The user must choose between name1 and name2 - "Choose between *Name1* and *Name2*"

Validate amount of pencils that can be removed
- Cannot remove moe than 3 at a time, so players can only remove 1, 2, or 3 pencils in a turn
"Possible values: '1', '2' or '3'"
- If a player takes more pencils than available - "Too many pencils were taken"





The user selects how many pencils in the game.
I need something that will make sure that it is a integer input first
